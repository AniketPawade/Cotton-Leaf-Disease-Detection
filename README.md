# Cotton-Leaf-Disease-Detection
The production profit can be improved by leaf disease detection in correct time. The Cotton leaves are affected by the disease named Cercospora, Bacterial blight, Ascochyta blight, and Target spot. 
General observation by farmers may time consume, expensive and sometimes inaccurate. For this, introduce Deep Convolutional Neural Network based approach for identifying Cotton leaf diseases automatically.
